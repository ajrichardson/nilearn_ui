How to registered a new script
==============================

see nilearn_ui/script/run_canica.py or nilearn_ui/script/run_canica.py

Scripts must be saved in /Scripts directory.
To be registered its name must start with ``run_`` and end with ``.py``
This scripts needs a least a funtion having the same name as the script (without ''.py'').
For example main funtion of run_canica.py is ``run_canica``.

Graphical unit interface description is stored in main function docstring
following this rules :

* main function must have a docstring

* docstring first line is used in the selection widget

* a Parameter section is mandatory

* each line in Parameter section must be formatted as::

    parameter name: (default value) a description used by widget tooltip
